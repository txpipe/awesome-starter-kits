# Kupo (JavaScript) Starter Kit

This starter kit contains two examples using Kupo for relatively different use-cases. On the one hand, it shows how to use Kupo to temporarily watch specific data on-chain; and on the other hand, it shows how it can also be used to index and aggregate a large amount of data in a quick fashion by leveraging streaming.

While the examples are written in plain JavaScript (Node.js 14+ required), keep in mind that Kupo provides a language-agnostic HTTP API. Thus, the same approaches translate well to any language.
