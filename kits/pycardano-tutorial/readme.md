# PyCardano Starter Kit

This Starter-Kit is a small tutorial of how to use the [PyCardano](https://pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for generating addresses, querying an address UTXOs and submit a basic transaction to transfer ADA in between 2 addresses.

[PyCardano](https://pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Cardano library written in Python. It allows users to create and sign transactions without depending on third-party Cardano serialization tools, such as cardano-cli and cardano-serialization-lib, making it a lightweight library, which is simple and fast to set up in all types of environments.
