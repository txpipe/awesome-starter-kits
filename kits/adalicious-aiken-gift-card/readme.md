# Adalicious - Aiken Gift Card

This is an example of a gift card. With these contracts you can lock anything
and have it be unlockable only with a simultaneously minted NFT. This minted NFT
holds the power to unlock the assets and is considered the "gift card".

This starter kit is based on the `Gift Card` example provided in the [Aiken documentation](https://aiken-lang.org/), adapted to work seamless with the Ogmios and Kupo instance provided by [Demeter](https://demeter.run) and implemented as a NextJS application. 

Reference the official documentation for details about how this starter kit was implemented and the logic behind the validators at the [Gift Card example](https://aiken-lang.org/example--gift-card).
