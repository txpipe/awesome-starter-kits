## Introduction

Starter kits are example code repositories that you can use for learning or as starting point for your own projects.
Each kit aims to solve a specific task and uses a particular tech stack. Once you find a kit that fits your needs, you can use it to create your own personal workspace in <a href="http://demeter.run" target="_blank">Demeter.run</a> based off that code template.

This repository works as an index of available Starter-Kits which are available and listed in  <a href="http://demeter.run" target="_blank">Demeter.run</a> platform.

## How To Use

To include your Starter Kit in <a href="http://demeter.run" target="_blank">Demeter.run</a> you need to submit a pull request to this repository with the information required to list your project.

**1.** Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/txpipe/awesome-starter-kits.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd awesome-starter-kits
```

**2.** Create a new branch for adding the metadata with your Starter Kit information.

```bash
# Create a new branch
$ git checkout -b starter-kit/my-awesome-starter-kit
```

**3.** Create a new folder for your Starter Kit.

```bash
# Create a new directory
$ mkdir kits/my-awesome-starter-kit

# Go into your new feature
cd kits/my-awesome-starter-kit
```

**4.** Add your Starter Kit metadata

Now you can create the file with the metadata for listing your starter kit. Metadata files are defined in <a href="https://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a> format:

```bash
# Create a new metadata file
$ touch metadata.yaml
```

You can always copy the metadata file from another starter kit into your folder and update the information in case you don't want to generate the metadata file from scratch.

Example format for your Starter Kit metadata:

<p align="right"><strong>metadata.yaml</strong></p>

```yaml
title: Name
logo: URL for your starter-kit logo
